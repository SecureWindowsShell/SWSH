A report should contain the following:

* A suitable title,
* Your SWSH, Windows, and .NET Framework version,
* Description of what happened and what was supposed to happen,
* Exact steps,
* And, your thought on how to fix this. :)

#### Example
**Title**: `connect` command is not working.

**Description**: 

* SWSH Version: Titan
* Windows 10 1709 
* .NET framework 4.7

`connect` command is not working if there is a space before it.

Steps: just run ` connect` with space.

Thoughts: Trim input taken from user.
