A report should contain the following:

* A suitable title,
* Your SWSH, Windows, and .NET Framework version,
* Description of what happened and what was supposed to happen,
* Exact steps,
* And, your thought on how to fix this. :)

#### Example
**Title**: Bug in swsh --show, characters not displaying correctly.
**Description**: 

* SWSH Version: beta 1.4
* Windows 10 1709 
* .NET framework 4.7

When I use `swsh --show` it is not displaying output correctly, there are ?'s in between lines. 

Steps: just run `swsh --show`

Thoughts: You should change encoding of output or something.
